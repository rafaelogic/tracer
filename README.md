# tracer

A simple contact tracer for a school used in pandemic. It will allow users to enter names of their visitors and generate a QR code for them on their first visit and the next visits will be just scanned and logs the date and time of their visits. It is offline as I used sqflite to store the records on user's mobile phone.

This is my first flutter project.
